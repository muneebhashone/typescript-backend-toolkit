## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker + Docker Compose**

     ```sh
     docker compose up -d
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Use pnpm to install all the necessary dependencies:
     ```sh
     pnpm i
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Use the provided `.env.sample` as a template to enter all the required environment variables.

## File Upload with MagicRouter

MagicRouter now supports multipart/form-data file uploads with automatic OpenAPI documentation generation. This feature works seamlessly with Multer middleware.

### Usage

#### Single File Upload

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
import MagicRouter from './openapi/magic-router';
import { zFile } from './openapi/zod-extend';
import { uploadMiddleware } from './middlewares/multer-s3';

const router = new MagicRouter('/api');

router.post(
  '/upload',
  {
    requestType: {
      body: z.object({
        avatar: zFile(),
      }),
    },
    contentType: 'multipart/form-data',
  },
  uploadMiddleware,
  handleUpload,
);
```

#### Multiple Files Upload

```typescript
import { zFiles } from './openapi/zod-extend';

router.post(
  '/upload-multiple',
  {
    requestType: {
      body: z.object({
        images: zFiles(),
      }),
    },
    contentType: 'multipart/form-data',
  },
  uploadMiddleware,
  handleMultipleUpload,
);
```

#### Mixed Fields (Text + Files)

```typescript
router.post(
  '/upload-with-data',
  {
    requestType: {
      body: z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        email: z.string().email(),
        avatar: zFile(),
        documents: zFiles().optional(),
      }),
    },
    contentType: 'multipart/form-data',
  },
  uploadMiddleware,
  handleUploadWithData,
);
```

### Content Types

MagicRouter supports three content types:

- `application/json` (default)
- `multipart/form-data` (for file uploads)
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (for form submissions)

### Key Features

- **Automatic OpenAPI Generation**: File upload endpoints are automatically documented in Swagger
- **Multer Compatible**: Works with existing Multer middleware without changes
- **Type-Safe**: Zod validation for text fields while Multer handles file validation
- **Flexible**: Support for single files, multiple files, and mixed text/file fields

## Roadmap

- **Socket.io Support:** Adding support for Redis adapter and a chat module.
- **Notification Infrastructure**: Notifications via FCM and Novu.
- **Ansible Playbook** : Create an Ansible playbook for server configuration to set up a basic environment quickly and consistently.
- **AWS CDK Support** : Integrate AWS CDK for infrastructure management, making it easier to deploy and manage cloud resources.
- **Monorepo Support** : Implement monorepo architecture using Turborepo and Pnpm for better project organization and scalability.
- **AWS Lambda Support** : Add support for deploying serverless functions on AWS Lambda.
- **Cloudflare Workers Support** : Enable Cloudflare Workers support for edge computing and faster request handling.
- **Containerization with Docker** : Implement containerization to ensure the project can be easily deployed to any environment using Docker.
- **Kubernetes Support** : Integrate Kubernetes for container orchestration, enabling scalable and automated deployment of the application.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** : Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- **Testing with Jest**: Add support for unit and integration testing using Jest to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
